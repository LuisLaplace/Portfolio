# Portfolio
Portfolio for career and jobsites

# Header
I added a simple header with a nave bar that links to the about-me, work, contact-me, and resume sections of the webpage.

# About me
The about me section is just a sample with a generic avatar picture.  It has my name and some flavor text

# Work
The work section has a linked picture of week 1 challenge and space for other future projects.  when you hover above the image it skews 15 degrees as per requested

# Resume
The resume section is a simple 2 bar with the title "Resume" and some flavor text at the bottom

# Contact Me
The contact me section has 2 input boxes for the name and email.  The link to email me is made styled so as to look like a button

# Footer
The footer is has a small msg and black background

# Webiste
